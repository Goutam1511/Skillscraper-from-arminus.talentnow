# Skillscraper-from-arminus.talentnow
This repository scrapes the key-skills listed in a job offer at http://arminus.talentnow.com/Careers/CurrentOpenings.aspx if a Job Code is provided and in return shows a list of questions fetched from the Cleartest API in a chat application format.  

To test the project please feel free to clone it and then open the Chat front end.html file and paste a valid job code whose questions against the keyskills are to be retrieved in the text box for Job Code. Job codes are to be given from urls of job offers listed at the above link only since this project only scrapes the above job portal but to scale it for other job portals please refer to the Documentation.pdf that answers basic FAQs.
